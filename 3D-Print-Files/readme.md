# 3D Print Files
The entire console is 3D printed, consisting of 2 primary parts:
* The **Bracket**, which is the internal plating holding all the internal components together, and
* the **Shell**, which is the outer shell of the console.

All the parts was drawn in Fusion 360 and exported here as `.iges` files.
